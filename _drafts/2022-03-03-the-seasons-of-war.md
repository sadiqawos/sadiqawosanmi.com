The season of war is one that comes with an immersurable cost. loss of a brother in arms, the agony of mothers watching thier babies sent to war all for the sake of an ideal held dearly in the hearts of thier fellow persons. Nothing comes with greater consequences than the season of war, the agressor shows the intention they have to enter a war, and the victim is either forced to resist with the fortitude equal to its stengths or accepts their fate and bend to the will of the enemy forces. In any course of action, every indecision is a decision that brings forces on either side closer to death. Even worse, the persons the wars have been started in their names get further away from a knowledge of who they are as permission is never requested to enter a war. These citizens siminingly have a choice of life or death, they either get steam rolled by the enemy and end up taking refuge in neighbooring countries, or they show up to the front and pay the ultimate price. This looks like death or death.

War shatters the facade of our seamingly inpenetrable world view. Parts of us die physically and metaphorically, soon to be rebuilt from the ground up so long as our ideals and values remain in our heart. The fundamental gift is life and we must reason up from that being the basis.

Dying on the battle field is no different from the feeling of having lost a home. A place that exists in ones heart, real only for a moment and fading at every attempt to grasp it. The burden of a dream you can not snap out of, the longing to unpack, the desire to take stock of ones belongings without the essense.
