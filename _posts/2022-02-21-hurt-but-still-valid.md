—– My father. He thought me how to be useful, he thought me to create more than I consume and to leave this place net positive. If I fail at everything in life I won't fail at being useful.

The above is really what I want to say without additions yet <!--more-->something about it just doesn't seem right. Maybe it's because of the complex relationship with my father, maybe it's because when I look at his life wholistically I mostly see examples of how fast things can go wrong. Still, I'm unable to shake the above thought. The thought has made its way all around the different pathways of my mind, falling through the web of absurdity and eventually coming out the other side to make it into this post and I don't want to accept the reality where these thoughts are valid.

The other night I was writing my nightly reflections - on paper of course when the thought of my father came to mind. I paused for a long while, minutes had gone by when I realised that I was on the brink of tears. It has dawned on me that my father has had a great impact on the man I'm becoming, yet I could not bring myself to feel this freely. I could not bring myself to share my most sincere gratitude for what he gave me.

—– hurt but still valid
