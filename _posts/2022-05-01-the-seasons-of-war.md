### the season of war
On the eve of the war, I thought this was the beginning of the end. A few months passed and all that remains is the heaviness in my heart, whatever happened to those people who preemptively migrated in hopes of a fresh start in new lands? I told myself that I'm not allowed to have opinions on the suffering of others as long as I've not had experience with war, yet here I am, still with a heavy heart feeling the need to sort through it.

I share the heartache of a home left behind. The home left behind in my story comes from my parent's search for greener pasture during my early teenage years. As a first-generation immigrant of 13 years in Canada, I have memories of myself in other homes, a boy in another life perhaps with entirely different hopes and dreams. What could have been shall remain unknown, what exists now is just a crossover of dreams. Memories of a place slowly collapsing into new dreams, memories that still exist in my heart, only real for a moment fading at every attempt to grasp them. This is the burden of a dream you can't snap out of, the longing to unpack, the desire to take stock of your belongings yet feel like many boxes were lost during the move.
