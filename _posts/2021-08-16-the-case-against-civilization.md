In one of those existential moods again. Not the spiralling out of control kind, but still unsettling enough to collect my thoughts in writing. I've usually found clarity at the bottom of one of these pits or at least I have something to look back on and think to myself how incredibly wrong I've gotten it, but I digress. the thought of whatever actually happened to ancient Egyptians has recently been on my mind. it seems that most evidence of their existence point to the fact that they were quite an advanced civilization. when thinking about the construction of the pyramids I find myself wondering how such a civilization erected incredibly intricate structures without leaving detailed plans<!--more-->

>to whom much is given much is expected

the internet, pocket-sized supercomputers, rapidly reusable rockets, mRNA vaccines... the last two decades have seen such a massive amount of knowledge creation. today in 2021 it seems trivial that any of these advancements exist. i certainly catch myself in awe of the ingenuity in the civilization i've been born into. for such an advanced civilization we certainly don't do enough to shield ourselves from a non-zero chance of evolutionary degeneration.  

my last eight years of building digital systems in the fintech space have opened my eyes to the small culminating decisions that affect the behaviour of a larger group. i've seen a movement towards abstraction of software at both the knowledge and implementation levels. this isn't all bad, as a civilization grows in complexity it's only logical that the problems of today are being solved with the knowledge of yesterday. we are standing on the shoulders of giants, we build upon history. that's precisely what evolution is. in fact, any civilization that forgets yesterdays lessons is doomed and almost guaranteed to learn the same lessons twice.

the pyramids in Giza were built ~4,500 years ago by the pharaohs of Egypt. they intended for these structures to endure eternity and so they have. but the fact still stands, the Giza Pyramids remain a mystery of the ancient world and studies are frequently conducted in hopes to uncover some missing piece of the puzzle. it's evident that reverse engineering can't always be trusted to recover the knowledge that once created something as great as the pyramids of Giza. the consequence of forgotten lessons is simply degeneration. we have come too far

>"sometimes a dynamic increment goes forward but can find no latching mechanisms and so fails and slips back to a previous latched position. whole species and cultures get lost this way. sometimes as static patterns become so powerful it prohibits any dynamic moves forward. in both cases, the evolutionary process is halted for a while. but when it's not halted the result has been an increase in power to control hostile forces or an increase in versatility or both. the increase in power to control hostile forces is directed toward static quality. without dynamic quality, the organism cannot grow. without static quality, the organism cannot last. both are needed."

the above quote is from Lila, Robert Pirsig's book on "An Inquiry into Morals". Lila left an impression on me for many reasons but the following stood apart. in the book Lila, Pirsig makes a very strong case for the Metaphysics of Quality, he postulates that everything that exists has quality and further describes quality as either being static or dynamic. to me, it seems that the dynamic qualities in our society have generated a wealth of knowledge and static qualities are the checks and balances that prevent evolutionary degeneration.

to be continued...
