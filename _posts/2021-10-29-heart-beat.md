in the shower...

moments leading to this slice of time heavy. wish it to be over, for burdens to be washed away. the wish now to be still, leave the pain space. things i do not wish to explain.

check-in with self. recurring calendar event... till death. mind has been a mess, things they left behind, 8max, lex, her

 -- in coversation with self
