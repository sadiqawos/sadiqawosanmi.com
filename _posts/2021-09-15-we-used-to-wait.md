on a night in may, or was it june? i can't quite remember but we drove around in my sports car thing without any destination. thinking about it now, it was probably april because i remember the feeling of cold air in my lungs when we got out of the car at port credit. we had driven from east to west on lakeshore listening to the suburbs by arcade fire.
the entire night felt familiar, a late-night fast <!--more--> food run became a two-hour drive. was it to mcdonald's or tims? it all felt familiar in a very primitive way, i didn't know what was exactly going to happen next nor did i attempt to put my finger on it. i knew the time would pass and the road would carry us to a nearby adventure. a new story was unfolding yet i felt right at home.

every road has a story and every one of its curves has a lesson to teach. a motel sign saying "no vacancies" started this chapter, an incoherent stream of thoughts that inspired this series of photos. we wondered how many more of these feelings we would permit ourselves to feel on a night like tonight. shortly after, a dilapidated coin car wash with the bay still steaming, breathing, just as it once did before esso's and the touchless folks came to town. the bankers should have axed this thing long ago, but a part of me would like to believe they have a heart for moments that feel familiar. just as i do.

we went forth. the night grew cold as we anticipated quality days ahead. soon it would be summer and we would think back to days of finding solace in the mundane. the simplicity, oh so fragile. if only we could hang onto these moments. Oh, we used to wait
