<strong>Insights And Introspection</strong> —– An end of the year ramble

I get the sense that everyone is celebrating something this time of year. The great success of making it through another arbitrary block of time, the birth or death of Jesus - not sure which... anyway, somewhere in the fine prints of the contracts between man and society, it has been stated that we shall observe the mandatory celebration of something during this time period. one has to admit that it's a little odd, collectively we've decided that <!--more--> the end of the year is a good time to tally up the totals and reset the counters of achievement. we've accepted the end of the year as a save-point in the long-running simulation we are part of. I'm writing this for a reason I promise. The reasons elude me at present however, I have an uneasy feeling that is rooted in the fact that I'm beginning to fit nicely into this arbitrary-time-block-following society of ours.

Since I've made a conscious effort to reflect on the year that has passed, it's only logical that everything is under the microscope for observation. This includes the basis for an end of the year reflection versus an ongoing reflection and examination of the circumstances I find myself. I must question the fundamentals of this activity and why it is important to me. furthermore, can a celebration be had without reflection? Why are these end of year reflections unlike any other point of reflection?

I do have to admit, it feels good to look back on a year that has been well executed. The feeling that in retrospect I can actually pinpoint when I got my shit in order. I may have actually figured out what I was trying to say above about end of the year celebrations. While they may seem superfluous and unnecessary in the short term, celebrations of this sort are important aspects of our humanity. Over the long arc of our human experience on earth, we probably find it hard to recall the fine details of a life lived. Looking back on a lifetime using this concept of time blocks, we can neatly organize our memories and subsequently recall our most distant experiences. I have a feeling this is the underpinnings of why photo albums became so sticky with humans. Photographs are neatly inserted into archival sheets, archival sheets are precisely bound together chronologically in a binder, binders are stacked and organized on a bookshelf... 

I guess this arbitrary-time-block-following society isn't so bad!


—– This is not supposed to be an esoteric philosophical debate, I'm actually wrestling with the disconnects between an artist in reality vs romantic ideas of an artist

Nothing seems more mysterious and enticing as the life of a working artist, they are portrayed as eccentric weirdos with zero to no economic prospects of course unless the artist comes to their senses and brings in a "real adult" to conduct the feasibility studies and market analysis to see what the people want. This isn't a rant about art but rather of the life of an artist. Take for instance an artist at the highest level of their craft such as Kanye. Kanye arguably reached the pinnacle of his music career years ago, he created records that will live forever as masterpieces in their own right. I pick on Kanye for no other reason than his die-hard fans are still hurt about his new musical direction. Kanye is also multifaceted which means he affects the lives of numerous demographics. The suburban Moms on his back are upset that their sons have a strong desire to cop just about anything he drops through the Yeezy line whilst asking for copious amounts of cheddar!

The fact is anyone who has followed the story of Kanye know that at one point or the other he's been seen as crazy or unworthy of anything he has. The media has labelled him out of control numerously and may have even wanted him gone! (source - twitter bro)

The idea here is simple, our society focuses all its energy on the output of artists yet discredit the fundamental aspect of the artist's role in society. The artists are the greatest disruptors in any society, they are the torch carriers of something philosopher Robert Pirsig eloquently describes as dynamic quality.

> “sometimes a dynamic increment goes forward but can find no latching mechanisms and so fails and slips back to a previous latched position. whole species and cultures get lost this way. sometimes as static patterns become so powerful it prohibits any dynamic moves forward. in both cases, the evolutionary process is halted for a while. but when it’s not halted the result has been an increase in power to control hostile forces or an increase in versatility or both. the increase in power to control hostile forces is directed toward static quality. without dynamic quality, the organism cannot grow. without static quality, the organism cannot last. both are needed.” Lila: An Inquiry Into Morals - Robert M. Pirsig

Our civilization will stagnate without artists. Artists are dreamers, they look beyond what the eyes see or what the ear hears. They feel things deeply and through sheer strength and perseverance, they create something that shows us all a version of the world we want but are unable to express.   

> We need art. But we need artists more —– me


I built this complex story in my head, when It came time to put pen to paper I found an even more complex task of untangling the mess I had created. The story has no interesting beginning or end, the middle is very janky and has many subplots but it's my story. I know how it operates and how to navigate it without losing my mind. It's beautiful actually. I have a feeling that we all have a version of this story, we have to. otherwise, how do we begin to make sense of the world around us??
